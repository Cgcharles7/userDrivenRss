# **userDrivenRSS**

### **Description:**
UserDrivenRSS is a conceptual social platform where users can share and discover curated RSS feeds based on personal interests. The idea is to create a decentralized and community-driven feed discovery mechanism that is powered by recommendations and user interaction. This project aims to provide a social experience for RSS feeds, allowing users to follow feeds, vote on them, and share their curated collections with others.

### **Key Features:**
- **RSS Feed Submission**: Users can submit their favorite RSS feeds to be shared with the community.
- **User Recommendations**: Users can recommend RSS feeds based on their interests and activity, with automated recommendations tailored to each user's preferences.
- **Community Interactions**: Users can comment on and vote for RSS feeds, creating a feedback loop that guides others toward the best content.
- **Private/Public Feeds**: Users have the ability to share their feeds privately or publicly, maintaining control over their content.

### **Goals:**
- To build a platform where users control their own content and recommendations, bypassing traditional social media platforms.
- To create a decentralized, user-curated feed discovery system powered by community-driven interactions.

### **How It Works:**
1. **Users**: Create an account, submit their RSS feeds, and engage with others by recommending, voting, and commenting on the RSS feeds shared by other users.
2. **RSS Feeds**: These feeds can be either private or public, giving users control over who can see them.
3. **Recommendations**: The platform will use an automated system that suggests RSS feeds to users based on their activity, preferences, and community interactions.
4. **Community**: Users interact by voting, commenting, and curating feeds, contributing to a social experience that enhances feed discovery.

### **Technology Stack**:
- **Frontend**: (e.g., React, Vue.js, etc.)
- **Backend**: (e.g., Python with Flask, Django)
- **Database**: (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- **RSS Parsing**: (e.g., FeedParser, etc.)
- **Authentication**: (e.g., OAuth, JWT)
